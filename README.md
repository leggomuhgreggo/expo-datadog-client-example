# expo-datadog-client

> NOTE: FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.

This is copied from a private monorepo. None of the dev / build functionality is hooked up.

It's definitely got some rough edges.

The Type Defs for the `init` method was challenging and at some point I want to rework it so it's less convoluted.

Also want to note that even if the client interfaces can be standardized, the reporting / instrumentation is still pretty different between platforms.
